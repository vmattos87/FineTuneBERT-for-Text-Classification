# FineTuneBERT-for-Text-Classification
Using a fine tuned BERT for text classification on Quora's Insincere Questions dataset

This is a project on fine-tuning a Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding (BERT) model for text classification with TensorFlow. In this project, we preprocess and tokenize data for BERT classification, build TensorFlow input pipelines for text data with the tf.data API, and train and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model for text classification with TensorFlow 2 and TensorFlow Hub.
